			<h3>Welcome to <span style=" font-family: 'Engagement', cursive; font-size:30px; color:#1a8773;">Janani Developers</h3></span>
			<p>In this fast-changing temple city world, it's very difficult for every body to own a house. Indeed, a house is every one's need, thus it becomes our ultimate dream. Our nation's economy is not as fast growth-oriented as it should be, because of which most of the people in our country, some times have to shelve their life-time earnings just to own a house of their choice. Here, Janani Developers, (pioneers in real estates, developers and promoters of housing colonies and ventures) plays a pivotal role. The main concept of the organization is to turn the long-cherished dreams of many citizens, who aspired to own a house, into a stern reality.</p>
			<p>Janani Developers came into being. A keen sense of quality aesthetics coupled with clean ecological balance are the twin inter-related subjects that are never forgotten by the promoters, while undertaking any project comprising housing colonies. A temple, indoor and outdoor stadiums, school and mini-supermarket are the common features of the colonies developed by Janani Developers.<a href="#"><span  class="pull-right"> read more&hellip;</span></a></p>
